        "\n",
        "1.  What is a parameter?\n",
        "    - a parameter refers to a configuration variable that is internal to the model and whose value is learned from the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is correlation What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "    - correlation(r) define that how closely two variable move together\n",
        "    - if r=0 i.e no correlation\n",
        "    - if r =1 i.e perfect positive correlation\n",
        "    - if r = -1 i.e perfect negative correlation\n",
        "    - negative correlation means one variable is increasing and other is decreasing\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "    - machine learing is a branch of artifical intelligence that  learning pattern from data, and replicate same in future\n",
        "    - to understand the mathemetical relationship\n",
        "    - main component of machine learning are Data, Model , Feature , Algorithm , Optimaisation\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "    - it help in measure prediction error, compare other model , warnings for underfitting and overfitting\n",
        "    \n",
        "5.  What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "    - continous variable can take any vlaue in a range and it play very crucial role in machine learning\n",
        "    - categorical variable are the variable that display a group or category\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "    - we can handel categorical variable by label encoding and ordinal encoding and target encoding\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "    - if we have 100% data then we give 70% in traning of model and 30% data in testing of model\n",
        "     - in school we train studient and then validate student by taking internal exam and then we test them by taking external test\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "    - from sklearn.preprocessing is use to import many dataset like mode , correlation , label encoder , Normilizer\n",
        "    - it is a module in python\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is a Test set?\n",
        "    - it is a portion of dataset that is not use for traning the data but is use for evulate the model that it is perfectvely made or not\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "     - we split data to minimize the error of model\n",
        "     - fristly import train_test_split from sklearn_model_selection\n",
        "     - 2nd :- make data , and by some basic formate we do spliting\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        "     - EDA(exploratoey data analysis ) is a cross industry standard process for data warning\n",
        "     - EDA is perform for data understanding that now much data is numerical and how much is object and how much is float and to convert it into numerical formate\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What is correlation?\n",
        "     - it is a statistical measure that describe relation between two variable\n",
        "     - if r=0 i.e no correlation\n",
        "     - if r =1 i.e perfect positive correlation\n",
        "     - if r = -1 i.e perfect negative correlation\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "     - negative correlation means one variable is increasing and other is decreasing\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        "     - frist import pandas as pd\n",
        "     - then make pd.DataFrame()\n",
        "     - then make corr_matrix = df.corr()\n",
        "     - then print(corr_matrix)\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example?\n",
        "     - it means one event directly cause another to happen\n",
        "     - correlation means variable are related to each other\n",
        "     - correlation can exist without causation but casation implies correlation\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example?\n",
        "     - it is a algorithm use to adjust the parameter of a machine learning model\n",
        "     - it is use to minimize the loss during traning\n",
        "     - types are :- GD, SGD, momentum, Adagrad\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What is sklearn.linear_model ?\n",
        "     -it is a module in sckit.learn that provide linear model for regression\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
        "     - it is use to train a machine learning modle using traning data\n",
        "     - argument are input variable and target variable\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
        "     - it is used to make prediction of trained model\n",
        "     -Once you've trained (fit) your model on some data, you use predict() to estimate outcomes for new, unseen input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.  What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?\n",
        "     - it tries to live all the feature on same scale\n",
